                <p>
                  The decision to relocate your business or move with your
                  family to Cyprus comes with the decision to enhance your
                  quality of life. As Cyprus is among the most beloved travel
                  destinations for millions of tourists every year, an
                  increasing number of individuals and families have decided to
                  turn the Mediterranean island into their permanent home. With
                  over 17% of its population being international migrants,
                  Cyprus has numerous expat communities all around the island.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Becoming a permanent resident in Cyprus offers you the
                  opportunity to enjoy a multitude of benefits, helping your

                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s important to know that Cyprus Permanent Residency can be
                  obtained by purchasing property or living in Cyprus for a
                  continuous period of five years or more. Some of the most
                  important benefits of becoming a permanent resident in Cyprus
                  are the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li className="list-disc">
